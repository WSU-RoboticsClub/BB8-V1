# BB8-V.1-Controls

A program created to control a homemade BB-8 robot via Bluetooth. Signals will
be inputed through a small joystick and transmitted over the two implemented
Bluetooth antennas to then control the motors within the robot.

This is Version 1 of what will eventually be an autonomous robot that can track
users and follow them around a room environment

 - Utilizes the HC-05 Bluetooth Module to transmit the signal and thr HC-06 Bluetooth Module
